# Ruby on Rails Tutorial: first application

This is the first application for 
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial: Learn Rails by Example*]{http://railstutorial.org}
by [Michael Hartl]{http://michaelhartl.com}.

Actually this is my second time going through the tutorial but since I don't 
use Ruby a lot I thought I'd "Sharpen the Saw"
